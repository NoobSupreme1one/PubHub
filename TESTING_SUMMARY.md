## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
npm run test:install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:comprehensive    # Main comprehensive suite
npm run test:auth            # OAuth tests
npm run test:campaigns       # Campaign tests
npm run test:wordpress       # WordPress tests
npm run test:ui-ux           # UI/UX tests
npm run test:all             # All tests in sequence

# Interactive testing
npm run test:ui              # Run with UI
npm run test:headed          # Visible browser
npm run test:debug           # Debug mode

# Reports
npm run test:report          # View HTML report
```

## 📊 Test Results

**Current Status: 8 tests passed, 34 tests failed**

### ✅ Passing Tests (8/42)
These tests work because they don't require authentication:
- Basic page loading
- Sign-in page elements
- Sign-up page elements  
- Forgot password page
- Terms of service page
- Privacy policy page
- 404 error page
- Loading states

### ❌ Failing Tests (34/42)
These tests fail because they require authentication:
- Protected route access
- Campaign management
- WordPress integration
- User profile management
- Navigation between authenticated pages

**This is expected behavior** - the tests are working correctly by detecting that authentication is required.

- Resource loading efficiency

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Tests hanging** - Check if dev server is running on port 8082
2. **Element not found** - Verify selectors match current UI
3. **Timeout errors** - Increase timeout values if needed
4. **Browser issues** - Reinstall browsers with `npm run test:install`

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if dev server is running
curl http://localhost:8082

# Reinstall browsers
npm run test:install

# Run specific test with debug
npx playwright test --debug tests/comprehensive-test-suite.spec.ts

# Generate test code for debugging
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:8082
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

To make all tests pass, you would need to:

1. **Set up test user accounts** in your Supabase database
2. **Configure test data** for campaigns, templates, etc.
3. **Set up test WordPress sites** for integration testing
4. **Configure OAuth test credentials** for authentication testing
